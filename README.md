# The Competitive Coders
### This a repository for all the people intrested in Competitive coding or just simple assignment solutions.
### If you want to contribute then please make sure that your code is clean and readable, also add comments wherever necessary so it will be easy for
---
## You are welcome to make your own directories in the manner given below
(Just to make it easier for everyone)
- There will not be any more directories inside of these, except the projects obviously
    The reason is that it is simply hard to manage
    Using cd command to go leetcode then java then search...bad idea
- Instead, we will have a better file naming system to avoid using too many folders
The file naming convention:
- CompetitiveCoding
    | <problemName><problemNumber(ifthere)><website><tag>
    In the tag, you can add your name or some code if there are multiple solutions to the same problem
    Example: 
    twosum_1_leetcode_coolApproach.py
    This indicates there is leetcode problem 1 called twosum in python, with a cool approach.
- Assignments
    yes, you can just post assignment solutions here if you are that eager, simply use:
    - tut/lab instead of website name 
    - Week instead of problem name
    - and the rest remains same
    - Example: W5B_6_lab_shortAns.c or W2_3_tut_mysol.c
