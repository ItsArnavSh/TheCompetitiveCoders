# The Competitive Coders
### This a repository for all the people intrested in Competitive coding or just simple assignment solutions.
### If you want to contribute then please make sure that your code is clean and readable, also add comments wherever necessary so it will be easy for

## Just to make it easier for everyone
- There will not be any more directories inside of these.
- The reason is that it is simply hard to manage
- Using cd command to go leetcode then java then search...bad idea
- Instead, we will have a better file naming system to avoid using too many folders
## The file naming convention:
### CompetitiveCoding
- problemName_problemNumber(ifthere)_website_tag
- In the tag, you can add your name or some code if there are multiple solutions to the same problem
- Example:  **twosum_1_leetcode_coolApproach.py**
- This indicates there is leetcode problem 1 called twosum in python, with a cool approach.
### Assignments
**Yes, you can just post assignment solutions here if you are that eager, simply use:**
- **tut/lab** instead of website name 
- **Week** instead of problem name
- and the rest remains same
- Example: **W5B_6_lab_shortAns.c** or **W2_3_tut_mysol.c**
